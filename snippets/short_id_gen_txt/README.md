# Short Id Generator 

This code sample demonstrates a simple C++ program for generating 8 alphanumeric string.

## Usage

This program was developed and tested using a C++ compiler (such as g++). Before compiling and running the code, ensure you have a compatible C++ compiler installed on your system.

After downloading this snippet or repository, you'll need to compile the code by going to directory from your linux terminal and inputting the following command:
```
   make
```

from there, you can basically follow this screenshot of me making and running the program. (the second linux terminal on the right is just for demonstrational purposes).

Then  if you want to bring everything back to its original state, type 
```
cd ..
```
into your linux terminal to return to `whatever/whatever/short_id_gen_text$` and type 

```
make clean
``` 
to bring it all back to how it was before you made it.

note: you'll have to `make` again if you want to use the program again.
