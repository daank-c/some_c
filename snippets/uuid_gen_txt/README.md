# UUID Generator 

This code sample demonstrates a simple C++ program for generating Version 4 UUIDs. UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) are 128-bit identifiers often used to uniquely identify resources.

## Usage

This program was developed and tested using a C++ compiler (such as g++). Before compiling and running the code, ensure you have a compatible C++ compiler installed on your system.

After downloading this snippet or repository, you'll need to compile the code by going to directory from your linux terminal and inputting the following command:
```
   make
```

from there, you can basically follow this screenshot of me making the program, generating text, then bringing everything back to its original state. ( if you 'make clean', you'll have to 'make' again if you want to use the program again.
